* Added support for Java 25 compact source files (JEP 512). The new predicate `Class.isImplicit()` identifies classes that are implicitly declared when using compact source files, and the new predicate `CompilationUnit.isCompactSourceFile()` identifies compilation units that contain compact source files.
